 Introduction
*********************


`PrimoGENI <http://www.primessf.net/PrimoGENIProject>`_ (**Prim**\ e **o**\ n **GENI**) aims to incorporate real-time network simulation
capabilities into the `GENI <http://geni.net>`_ "ecosystem". PrimoGENI is based on `PRIME <http://www.primessf.net/PRIME>`_ (Parallel
Real-time Immersive network Modeling Environment), our
existing real-time network simulation framework. 
PrimoGENI augments PRIME with the GENI aggregate interface to allow
PRIME to interoperate with other GENI infrastructure to support
large-scale experiments involving both physical and simulated network
entities. 


The goal of this document is four fold:
 * Provide instructions to configure, build, and install PrimoGENI.
 * Provide users information to quickly start using PrimoGENI to conduct experiments.
 * Provide a general overview of the PrimoGENI design.
 * Provide detailed APIs for those who wish to extend the core of PrimoGENI on their own.
