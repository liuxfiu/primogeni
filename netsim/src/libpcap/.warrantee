Bootstrap complete.  It's time to run configure.  If you are just messing
around then:

  ./configure
  make clean
  make

is sufficient.  A static library will be found in file "libpcap.a".

If you want to build libpcap as a shared library, then:

  ./configure --enable-shared
  make clean
  make

You will find the shared library in the .libs directory.

Finally, if you want to install the library in /usr/lib, then:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared
  make clean
  make install
  ldconfig

Good luck.  And remember, there is no warrantee.  You are basically on 
your own.  Check out README.ring for possible help.
