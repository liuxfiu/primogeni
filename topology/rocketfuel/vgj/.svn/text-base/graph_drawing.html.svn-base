<br><h2>About the project:</h2>
VGJ, Visualizing Graphs with Java, is a tool for graph drawing and graph layout.  Graphs can be input into VGJ in two ways:  with a textual description (<a href="http://www.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/">GML</a>), or through a drawing the user creates using our graph editor. The user can then select an algorithm to layout the graph in an organized and (hopefully) aesthetically pleasing way.    </p>
This graph drawing project is currently unfunded.  If you like what we're doing or if you want to use it commercially, please help support the graduate students working on the project.  You may hire us to customize the tool to your needs.</p>
The current version is 1.03, released on 4/20/98.</p>
