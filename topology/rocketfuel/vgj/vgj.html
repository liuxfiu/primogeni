Warnings:</p>
Your browser may prohibit load and save operations (but you should be able to cut and paste from the text editing and PostScript view windows).</p>
This applet works to a different degree of correctness on different browsers and other Java virtual machines. It seems to work quite well on Netscape Communicatior 4.03 for Windows.</p>

<h3>New Features:</h3>
Arbitrary data attributes (strings) for nodes and edges.</p>
Some command line functionality:<br>
   java EDU.auburn.VGJ.VGJ <-f gml_filename> <-s selected_node_id>
   <-l algorithm><br>
   The algorithm is the menu name, with a "." at sub-menu points, like
   "Tree.Tree Down". If the name contains spaces, you will have to quote it.</p>
<h3>Non-obvious features:</h3>
Hold down the shift key while selecting objects to keep previous selections.</p>
Hold down the shift key while creating edges to add bends.</p>
The delete key will delete selected objects.</p>
Double click on a node in node select mode to pop up a "Node Properties" dialog, and on an edge in edge select mode to pop up an "Edge Properties" dialog.</p>
<h3>Comments:</h3>
Edge labels are drawn with rotated, antialiased text. This is very slow, not because of computations, but because drawing pixels to the screen is slow. This problem is being corrected.</p>
Group nodes (Edit / Group Control). Group nodes form a forest where all
inner nodes are groups and all leaf nodes are "real" nodes in the graph.
Moving or resizing a group node moves or resizes all of its descendents.
The "Tree" algorithms automatically create a group structure for the
tree on which they operate. The application of any algorithm will destroy the current group structure.</p>
